    Notes
    -----
    The preprocess function must take in only a moncao.mc_case.Case object. It
    then must return a tuple of the input arguments for the run function.
    The run function will take in whatever inputs and return whatever outputs.
    It it recommended to package the outputs into a tuple.
    The postprocess function must take in as its first argument a
    moncao.mc_case.Case object, followed by the outputs from the run function.
    The simulation will attempt to unpack the run function outputs if they are
    stored in a tuple.

    See
    https://github.com/scottshambaugh/monaco/blob/main/template/template_functions.py
    for an example of this.
